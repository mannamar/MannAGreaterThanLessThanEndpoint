# MannAGreaterThanLessThanEndpoint

Project Description:
A GreaterThanOrLessThan application that will take two numbers as inputs and output a string letting you know which is bigger

Instructions:
1. Download the files and put them in their own folder, open the folder in VS Code, and start debugging (F5)
2. Navigate to "http://localhost:5110/GreaterThanLessThan" for the default output (you may need to change the port if it's different on your system > see debug console)
3. Append URL with two numbers such as "http://localhost:5110/GreaterThanLessThan/50/100" for a customized output
4. Enjoy!

Peer reviewed by Carlos Felipe: This code works great. The TryParse method is something new that I hadn't seen from others. The code writes out a correct response and the code looks to be formatted correctly.
